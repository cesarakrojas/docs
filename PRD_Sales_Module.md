interface SalesOrder {
  id: string;
  number: string;          // Auto-generated: "SO-{timestamp}"
  customerId: string;      // Reference to Contact (customer)
  orderDate: string;       // ISO date string
  lineItems: SalesOrderLineItem[];
  subtotal: number;        // Sum of all line item totals

  total: number;           // Subtotal minus total discount
  notes?: string;          // Optional additional information
  status: SalesOrderStatus; // 'completed' | 'canceled'
  createdAt: string;       // ISO timestamp
  updatedAt: string;       // ISO timestamp
